WorldLink is a mod that enables real-time cabinet-to-cabinet multiplayer with friends or random players worldwide. Originally developed by the AquaDX team, it has since been integrated into KanadeDX.

### 1. Setting Up

To use WorldLink, you need KanadeDX version **250306.0850** or later. Enable the **WorldLink Mod** in the launcher settings before starting the game.

#### Selecting a Server

Choose the lobby server closest to your location for the best connection. The available servers are:

- 🇺🇸 **US West**: `usw.link.aquadx.net`
- 🇺🇸 **US East**: `use.link.aquadx.net`
- 🇪🇺 **Europe**: `eu.link.aquadx.net`
- 🇯🇵 **Asia**: `asia.link.aquadx.net`
- 🇨🇳 **China**: `cn.link.aquadx.net`

Rooms created on one server **will not** appear on others, so ensure all players join the same server.

> **Note:** Due to design limitations, all rooms are public. If you prefer a private session, you can self-host a server using the [worldlinkd self-hosting guide](https://github.com/MewoLab/worldlinkd/blob/main/README.HOST.md).

### 2. How to Play

Once WorldLink is set up, follow these steps:

1. Select a song and navigate to **Cabinet-to-Cabinet Play**.
2. Press **Call Friends** to create a multiplayer room.

Each player can choose their own difficulty level, and the game will start once both players are ready.

> **Limitations:**  
> - A maximum of **two players** can join a room at a time.  
> - Due to the original game’s design, additional players are not supported.
